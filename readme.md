# How to use

how to add to the to-do list can make entering the name you want to make a to-do in "add a new taks" and after that click add and a list will appear in some lists there is crud that can make it easier to change and delete, and complete. to search for to-do can search in "search taks" and if it has been typed can click the search button, sorry if it is not realtime when searching. and there is a feature that has not been completed if the search results we want are not found then there is an option "Add To-do", here I do not include cache so when refreshed the to-do results page will disappear.
